# Enhancing-udemy-with-data-analysis
This project deals with performing data analysis on a data set based on the number of courses which are mainly opted by most of the students and few sub courses related to the main courses available on Udemy platform.The rapid growth of online learning platforms has revolutionized the way people acquire knowledge and skills. One of the leading platforms in this domain is Udemy, which offers various courses on diverse topics. As the number of courses and learners on Udemy continues to increase, the need for data analysis becomes crucial to gain valuable insights into the platform's performance, course trends, and user behavior. I Tried to analyze the data using python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib and few function and methods which are available under these libraires to clean, sort and visualize the data present in this data set.
